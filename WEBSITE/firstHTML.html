	<h1>Vigorous</h1>
	<h2>Randomness</h2>
	<p>
	According to Ramsey theory, <b>pure randomness is impossible</b>, especially for large structures. 
	Mathematician Theodore Motzkin suggested that "while disorder is more probable in general, 
	complete disorder is impossible". Misunderstanding this can lead to numerous conspiracy 
	theories.<br> Cristian S. Calude stated that "given the impossibility of true randomness, 
	the effort is directed towards studying degrees of randomness".</p>
	<p>
	It can be proven that there is <strong>infinite hierarchy</strong> <br><i>(in terms of quality or strength)</i> 
	of forms of randomness.
